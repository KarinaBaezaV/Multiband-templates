# High-Cadence Stellar Variability Studies of Galactic RR Lyrae Stars with DECam: New Multi-band Templates
We present the latest and enhanced versions of RR Lyrae templates in the griz bands, obtained with DECam on the Blanco 4 m telescope at CTIO. The main objective of this study is to examine RRab and RRc stars situated within the DECaPS East field, located in the Galactic bulge at coordinates (RA, DEC)(J2000) = (18:03:34, -29:32:02), through high-quality multi-band light curve templates. We have obtained a total of 143 RRab and 146 RRc multi-band light curve templates.
